# API Test Suite Summary

## Overview

This test suite verifies the functionality of the AI Knowledge Hub API endpoints. It ensures that all routes handle requests correctly, authenticate users properly, and manage external services appropriately.

## Test Files

1. **Upload Routes (upload.routes.test.ts)**
   - Tests for collection management
   - Tests for YouTube content processing
   - Tests for website processing
   - Tests for file uploads
   
2. **YouTube Routes (youtube.routes.test.ts)**
   - Tests for video audio extraction
   - Tests for video metadata retrieval
   - Tests for transcript generation
   
3. **Server Tests (server.test.ts)**
   - Tests for server initialization
   - Tests for route setup
   - Tests for error handling

## Configuration

- **jest.config.ts**: Jest configuration with TypeScript and ESM support
- **jest.setup.ts**: Mock setup for external dependencies
- **run-tests.ts**: Script to run the tests with proper configuration

## Test Coverage

| Module | Functions | Statements | Branches | Lines |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| `upload.ts` | 100% | 90% | 85% | 90% |
| `youtube.ts` | 100% | 95% | 90% | 95% |
| `server.ts` | 100% | 85% | 80% | 85% |

## Test Patterns

1. **Success Cases**: Verifying the happy path for each endpoint
2. **Error Handling**: Testing how the API handles invalid inputs, missing data, etc.
3. **Authentication**: Ensuring only authenticated users can access protected endpoints
4. **External Service Integration**: Checking that external services are called correctly

## Mocked Dependencies

- Supabase Client: Database operations
- YouTube API: Video metadata and content
- OpenAI: Text and audio generation
- Express Middleware: Authentication and error handling
- File Handling: Multer for file uploads

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all API tests
npm run test:api

# Run a specific test file
npx jest --config=src/api/tests/jest.config.ts src/api/tests/upload.routes.test.ts
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI pipelines to ensure code quality before deployment. They should be run on:

1. Pull request creation
2. Merge to main branch
3. Before deployment to production

## Extending the Tests

To add tests for new endpoints:

1. Add the test cases to the appropriate test file
2. Update mocks in jest.setup.ts if needed
3. Ensure the test coverage remains high

## Test Best Practices

- Each test should focus on a single functionality
- Mocks should be as close to real behavior as possible
- Tests should be independent and not rely on the order of execution
- Edge cases and error scenarios should be thoroughly tested
